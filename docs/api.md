## Introduction

This document contains a list of API endpoints and sample JSON outputs from
them. These are intended to aid in familiarizing oneself with the application
as well as for debugging it. In the tables below, values in curly brackets (like `{id}`)
represent a numeric id. Routes without an `/api/<version>` prefix are internal
and are expected to remain stable across application versions. Internal APIs
always require authentication.
